## Definition

The application of scientific principles to solve problems.

## Necessity and Usage

Nearly every problem nowadays is solved by tools (instead of directly by hand). As problems become more and more complex, tools are more and more powerful. the more powerful a tool, the more "little
tools" (component or module) it contains and engineering is the process of constructing existing tools to solve new problems.

Without engineering, we would probably still be drilling for fire today.
