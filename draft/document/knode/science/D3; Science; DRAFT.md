## Definition

The activity to find out consistent rules of the universe.

## Necessity and Usage

Imagine you are walking in the pure dark wild without a torch, how do you know which direction to move? Yes, you can touch the objects around you to guess the environment, but it's inefficient, and
most importantly, high risky. That's how we, the human, got where we are today. Science is the torch in the dark, the more we understand the universe the clearer we can see the future. Without science, even a
leaf could stop us from moving forward, since in darkness that's no different from a sword.
